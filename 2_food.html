                  Speaking of the history of Hong Kong street food, mobile hawkers were joined by  little green huts known as dai pai dong in the 1950s. Hundreds of them lined the streets near the factories droving the city’s booming economy. By the 1970s, more than 50,000 hawkers thronged the city’s streets. The government began to license the hawkers and assign them permanent places to ply their trade. However, their licences couldn’t be transferred. Eventually, the entire hawking trade was expected to die out. Unfortunately, No hawkers are permitted to sell food on the streets of Hong Kong anymore. If you want to sell food like stinky tofu, you’ll need to rent a shop space. Therefore, A few people flouted the law. Every Chinese New Year, the streets were filled with hawkers, forming a night market with the scent of grilled oysters and curry fish balls.

                  As a food heaven, there are a lot of street vendors selling mouth-watering Hong Kong snacks. Tofu Pudding is one of them. This pudding can be served hot or cold with brown sugar. Another one is the maltose crackers. It used to be one of the most affordable snacks in the 50s and 60s, especially for school kids. It is made of a sticky sweet maltose, rolled up on a thin strip of bamboo.

                  Hong Kong’s iconic yellow and white siu mai is about to get a fitting tribute – its own encyclopaedia as three Hongkongers administrate a popular facebook page called “Hong Kong Siu Mai Concern Group.” The group frequently shares food reviews and information on the best siu mai across the city. At the same time, the page also post submissions from other enthusiasts, who sometimes create peculiar recipes such as putting siu mai (or shumai) in a salad. The Siu mai concern group also launches a membership scheme that allows people who pay an entrance fee to the group to get  discount at local street food stores. Eating Siu mai seems an easy thing to do for hongkongers, but Emigrants from Hong Kong particularly treasure siu mai and other local street snacks as their page often got messages from Hongkongers living overseas, who would go out of their way to recreate the classic bite-sized food.

                  The source talks about the bunch of  traditional street snacks that are mouth-watering in Hong Kong. It includes the nostalgic, iconic golden puffs called egg waffles, called Gei Dan Jai. At the same time, there is also another type of Hong Kong style waffle called Gaa Zai Peng, which are packed with peanut butter and condensed milk. Moreover, we cannot miss the most iconic street food Siu Mai, that serves in fives on a bamboo skewer that is a to go snack for all Hong Kongers.

                  Besides the typical Hong Kong street food, Prawn toast is also a dim sum variety and   popular food in Hong Kong street. The way to make it is to cut the bread into a triangle topped with prawn paste, fry it and coat it with white sesame. Another typical but strange invention by the Hong Kong bakers would be the pineapple bun that contains no pineapple. However, it derives its name from the physical appearance that resembles that of a pineapple.
