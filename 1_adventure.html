                <p>
                    Under the gleaming sun, I can smell the sunscreen lingering in the air. I walked towards the surfing kiosk on Condado Beach in San Juan, Puerto Rico, feeling the warm sand against my feet. A few other young girls were walking towards the glimmering shore, ready to launch themselves into the sea.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Three?", asked the strong and muscular coach who is unbeatably hot and muscular.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    "Do you guys have any prior experience?"
                </p>               
                <p>
                    "No… "It's our first time," I murmured.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    "Don’t worry at all; I will guide you all. Come on! Let’s hit the waves!"
                </p>                
                <p>
                    I was flabbergasted by how hyped the coach is. Even though it has been a year since I wanted to do this, I was still a bit worried looking at the stench of waves. Nevertheless, I kicked off my sandals, dropped my surfboard onto the water, and I began my journey. As I approached the shore of the ocean, I saw the violent waves shaking the water. A sense of fear rushed over me, but I told myself everything was going to be fine.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    Lay down, look forward, and keep your legs straight. When the wave hits, stand up and balance yourself. Sounds easy, right? I cuffed my leg with the board's leash, hoping for the best.
                </p>                
                <p>
                    Pushing my surfboard to the middle of the sea, I stood and waited for the waves to hit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the first wave came. I climbed on the board, laid with my legs straight, as the waves started to push my surfboard towards the shore. The waves were pushing the surfboard so fast that I felt like I was on an ocean rollercoaster.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I tried over 30 times to stand up on the surfboard. However, I failed to stand up every single time when I try to. I lost my balance and fell into the ocean with my nose and mouth stuffed with salty sea water that makes me so thirsty that I wanted some tap water to drink immediately. As the sea water filled my nostrils and throat, I couldn't stop coughing and sneezing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After coughing so loudly for five minutes straight where everyone could hear me so clearly, I turned around to look at the shore. Looking back on the crowded beach, I felt embarrassed, as if I had performed a failure in front of 30 people who were sunbathing on the beach. Eyes were staring at me as if everyone thought that I was a loser who couldn’t balance at all. To prevent myself from digging a hole on the beach and hiding in it, I decided to look away to avoid embarrassment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I calmed myself down and tried to focus. I told myself that if I don't stand up successfully, I'm not leaving this beach. Half blinded by the sea water, a strong wave was coming from a far distance. While hoping that it wouldn’t knock me off my surfboard, I took a deep breath and climbed onto the board, waiting for the waves to hit. Finally, after lifting my right foot up, my left foot gripped the board firmly, so I could stand up and balance my entire body. I threw my hands in the air and yelled a scream of joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reaching the goal of my day, I left the water with a sore body. I went to pick up my camera, and I brushed off some of the sand that had gone into the lens. I walked to the shore and looked at my friend, who was also trying to balance on the fierce wave. I decided to capture the moment using my film camera. The one thing that I liked about a film camera is that you don’t get to see the picture you take immediately after you
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lying on the surfboard, floating in the ocean, is the best feeling I can have in this world. Suddenly, everything becomes so unimportant and insignificant. What matters the most is the present moment when I feel so alive, so free and so relaxed. Thinking back on the worries I had before, they suddenly seem so trivial that they are not worth thinking about. What matters most is to enjoy the present and live in the present.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I ended my day leaving the sinking sunset behind me with a radiant smile, making my way out of the beach. Facing the boundless ocean and hearing the pulse of the sea hitting the rocks at the shore, I felt like I was living my life to the fullest.
